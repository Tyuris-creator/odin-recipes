                    <li>¼ cup water</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                    <li>4 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
                    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon garlic chili sauce</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped peanuts</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 3 to 5 minutes; drain and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Fill a large bowl with warm water. Dip one wrapper into the hot water for 1 second to soften.</li>
            <li>Lay wrapper flat; place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center, add some cooled noodles, lettuce, mint, cilantro, and basil, leaving about 2 inches uncovered on each side.</li>
            <li>Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with lettuce. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>To make the chili sauce for dipping: Mix water, lime juice, sugar, fish sauce, garlic, and chili sauce in a small bowl until well combined.</li>
            <li>To make the second sauce for dipping: Mix hoisin sauce and peanuts in a separate small bowl.</li>
            <li>Serve spring rolls with the two sauce mixtures.</li>
        </ol>
